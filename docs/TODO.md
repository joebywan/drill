# Drill backlog

Not MVP. Ideas agreed in principle, to pick up later.

## Cross-device profiles and friends

Built 2026-10-30 (src/sync/, server/, privacy.html; see CLAUDE.md). Left: deploy it
(server/DEPLOY.md: Cloudflare account, D1, DNS move), a QR code beside the 6-digit code, and the
Android wrapper's internet permission if the app should sync.

Decided 2026-10-29 as the shape to build, when it's time:

- **No accounts.** A profile is a secret key held on the device. A new device joins with a
  short-lived 6-digit pairing code (or QR) shown on one already linked; a saved recovery code
  restores it if every device is lost. No email, no passwords, no third-party sign-in (Google
  blocks its sign-in inside embedded WebViews, which rules it out for the Android wrapper).
- **The device stays the source of truth.** localStorage is still the record; sync sits on top,
  so Drill works offline and in a browser with no backend at all.
- **Two things are uploaded:**
  - the full progress, **encrypted on the device** with a key derived from the recovery code
    (WebCrypto, no library). The server stores it but cannot read it. Conflicts are merged on
    the device (FSRS cards per card, latest review wins).
  - a small **public card** in plain form: streak, lessons done, current unit, chosen avatar.
    The server shows it only to accepted friends.
- **Friends** swap short friend codes and see each other's card. One cheer a day from a fixed
  set. Preset names and avatars, no free text, no search, unfriend/block: nothing to moderate.
- **Hosting:** Cloudflare Workers + D1 on the free plan ($0 at thousands of users; past the
  free limits requests fail, nothing is billed). Workers Paid ($5/month) is the next step;
  one D1 database tops out at 10 GB (~200k users at ~50 KB each). The app talks only to our
  own small sync API, so the backend can move without an app change.
- **Domain:** move knowhowit.com.au's DNS from FreeDNS to Cloudflare (free) so the API lives at
  `api.knowhowit.com.au`, an address we own. A CNAME to `workers.dev` does not work.
- **Obligations:** a short privacy policy; delete-my-data in the app and on a web page (Play
  requires both for apps with accounts); export for EU users. Storing no email keeps this small
  and safe for under-13s.

Researched 2026-10-29: Supabase (pauses after a week idle, 2 emails/hour built in), Firebase
(5 sign-in emails/day on free, highest lock-in), Appwrite (deletes idle projects after 90 days)
and a self-hosted PocketBase (~€6/month, own backups) were the alternatives.

## Feel

- More animation and sound throughout lessons and the path. Done: answer pop and shake, petal confetti, the
  path filling as Lumi hops, the next node bobbing, and generated cues for each (`cue()` in feel.js).

## Android wrapper

WebView shell serving the bundled app from `appassets.androidplatform.net` (as Saffron Road),
no internet permission, then a JS bridge passing a session summary, a home-screen widget
(streak flame tinted by today's light; Lumi plus one line) and opt-in local notifications.
Release setup copies Daybook's: one signing key from the first build, `assembleRelease` only,
checks that fail unsigned, wrong-key or debuggable APKs. App id `com.joebywan.drill`.

Widget and reminder mechanics, from a friend's Android habit app (Fizz) reviewed 2026-10-30:

- **Refresh at the boundaries, not just on a timer.** A 15-minute WorkManager job plus an
  inexact alarm at each point where the widget's look changes (midnight, and any time-of-day
  line pools). Midnight matters most: that's when `light()` can turn soft or ember.
- **One pure function picks the look:** `(light, hour) → background, Lumi pose, line pool`.
  Test it on the JS side and pass the result over the bridge, so the Kotlin side only renders.
- **Re-arm on `BOOT_COMPLETED` and `MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED`.** Android drops alarms on reboot
  and on update; a receiver for both re-schedules reminders and the widget refresh.
- **The reminder checks before it speaks:** if today's session is done, post nothing.
- **Not copied:** Fizz's escalating 19:30 / 21:45 / 23:00 "code red" nudges and panicking
  mascot (guilt, against the guardrails), and `USE_EXACT_ALARM`, which Play reserves for
  alarm and calendar apps. Inexact alarms are fine for a once-a-day reminder.

## Fitting the person

Agreed 2026-10-30: Drill learns from its own on-device log how to fit the person, so it reacts
in a way that suits them. It isn't there to guess their feelings. Fizz logs similar events to a
JSON Lines file but never reads them back; Drill should use them. Needs HABITS.md task 13, and
the Android wrapper for anything about notifications.

- **Remind when they actually practise.** Learn the hours sessions usually happen and send the
  reminder then. Don't remind early in the day if they never play then.
- **Back off from ignored reminders.** Log each reminder as opened or cleared. If they only ever
  clear them, remind less, or not at all, and say so once as a passive line in settings.
- **Notice a drop-off and offer a comeback.** When sessions per week fall well below their own
  usual, start a personalised comeback event built from what they did most (their favourite
  practice, at their usual hour, with a garden visitor as the reward). Inviting, never guilt.
- **Adjust what's offered.** A practice often left at the same step gets a shorter version
  offered; the ones they finish most come first on the path.
- Everything stays on the device, can be seen in the habit view, and goes in the file export.

Built in `src/fitting.js` (see CLAUDE.md): the reminders themselves are the Android wrapper's,
which calls `window.drill.reminderHour()`, `shouldRemind()` and `noteReminder(outcome)`.

## Coach voice

Agreed 2026-10-30: like Duolingo's characters, each coach has lines that encourage and,
sometimes, antagonise or challenge the player to get them to play more ("Moss bets you can't
do three slow breaths before lunch"). A challenge is a dare in character, sent once; it is not
Fizz's escalating run of panicked nags. Drill needs a way to generate these lines either way:
a tool that drafts lines per coach and state with an LLM at authoring time, for review and
committing, with the coach's voice described once per character.

Still open: whether lines are also written live on the device. Fizz writes its mascot's lines
with Bedrock (a cloud model, with built-in lines as the fallback). For Drill, which has no
internet permission:

- **Line pool:** many hand-reviewed lines per state (habit, streak, hour, light, comeback),
  drafted with an LLM at authoring time and shipped in the app, with slots for the person's own
  facts ("your usual evening breathing"). No download, same on web and Android.
- **On-device model:** Gemma 3 (270M or 1B) via Google's LiteRT / MediaPipe LLM runtime runs on
  most phones and on the web with WebGPU, but is a download of several hundred MB; Gemini Nano
  via ML Kit needs a recent flagship. Small models drift off a character's voice, so the pool
  stays as the fallback either way. Check the current options before choosing.
