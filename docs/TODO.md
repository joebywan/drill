# Drill backlog

Not MVP. Ideas agreed in principle, to pick up later.

## Cross-device profiles and friends

Decided 2026-10-29 as the shape to build, when it's time:

- **No accounts.** A profile is a secret key held on the device. A new device joins with a
  short-lived 6-digit pairing code (or QR) shown on one already linked; a saved recovery code
  restores it if every device is lost. No email, no passwords, no third-party sign-in (Google
  blocks its sign-in inside embedded WebViews, which rules it out for the Android wrapper).
- **The device stays the source of truth.** localStorage is still the record; sync sits on top,
  so Drill works offline and in a browser with no backend at all.
- **Two things are uploaded:**
  - the full progress, **encrypted on the device** with a key derived from the recovery code
    (WebCrypto, no library). The server stores it but cannot read it. Conflicts are merged on
    the device (FSRS cards per card, latest review wins).
  - a small **public card** in plain form: streak, lessons done, current unit, chosen avatar.
    The server shows it only to accepted friends.
- **Friends** swap short friend codes and see each other's card. One cheer a day from a fixed
  set. Preset names and avatars, no free text, no search, unfriend/block: nothing to moderate.
- **Hosting:** Cloudflare Workers + D1 on the free plan ($0 at thousands of users; past the
  free limits requests fail, nothing is billed). Workers Paid ($5/month) is the next step;
  one D1 database tops out at 10 GB (~200k users at ~50 KB each). The app talks only to our
  own small sync API, so the backend can move without an app change.
- **Domain:** move knowhowit.com.au's DNS from FreeDNS to Cloudflare (free) so the API lives at
  `api.knowhowit.com.au`, an address we own. A CNAME to `workers.dev` does not work.
- **Obligations:** a short privacy policy; delete-my-data in the app and on a web page (Play
  requires both for apps with accounts); export for EU users. Storing no email keeps this small
  and safe for under-13s.

Researched 2026-10-29: Supabase (pauses after a week idle, 2 emails/hour built in), Firebase
(5 sign-in emails/day on free, highest lock-in), Appwrite (deletes idle projects after 90 days)
and a self-hosted PocketBase (~€6/month, own backups) were the alternatives.

## Feel

- More animation and sound throughout lessons and the path.

## Android wrapper

WebView shell serving the bundled app from `appassets.androidplatform.net` (as Saffron Road),
no internet permission, then a JS bridge passing a session summary, a home-screen widget
(streak flame tinted by today's light; Lumi plus one line) and opt-in local notifications.
Release setup copies Daybook's: one signing key from the first build, `assembleRelease` only,
checks that fail unsigned, wrong-key or debuggable APKs. App id `com.joebywan.drill`.

Widget and reminder mechanics, from a friend's Android habit app (Fizz) reviewed 2026-10-30:

- **Refresh at the boundaries, not just on a timer.** A 15-minute WorkManager job plus an
  inexact alarm at each point where the widget's look changes (midnight, and any time-of-day
  line pools). Midnight matters most: that's when `light()` can turn soft or ember.
- **One pure function picks the look:** `(light, hour) → background, Lumi pose, line pool`.
  Test it on the JS side and pass the result over the bridge, so the Kotlin side only renders.
- **Re-arm on `BOOT_COMPLETED` and `MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED`.** Android drops alarms on reboot
  and on update; a receiver for both re-schedules reminders and the widget refresh.
- **The reminder checks before it speaks:** if today's session is done, post nothing.
- **Not copied:** Fizz's escalating 19:30 / 21:45 / 23:00 "code red" nudges and panicking
  mascot (guilt, against the guardrails), and `USE_EXACT_ALARM`, which Play reserves for
  alarm and calendar apps. Inexact alarms are fine for a once-a-day reminder.
